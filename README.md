HOW TO:

To view available cars a date range must first be selected, this will show all cars available within the selected range.

To rent a car one must be loged in, this is done simply by entering ones personnumber (YYYYMMDDxxxx). If this is your first time you will be promted to enter your name and a userprofile will be created for you.
Once a car is rented a cancle booking button will appear where you can cancle your booking

in order to ADD, UPDATE and DELETE cars one must be loged in as an Admin, this can be done by instead of entering your personnumber you enter "ADMIN" (without the quotes)

there you either fill out the form in order to add a new car to the collection or if you wish to change existing cars;
simply select the car you wish to edit in the list and the form will be filled with the cars properties where you may edit and update them or delete the whole car
